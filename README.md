KALNIRNAY: Gregorian to Hindi (Saka) Date Converter
---------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

This C project converts Gregorian calendar dates to their equivalent Hindi (Saka Samvat) dates using linked lists as its primary data structure. It demonstrates dynamic memory usage and struct-based design via a calendar mapping program suitable for academic coursework in Data Structures.​

Features
--------

*   Input any Gregorian date (DD MM YYYY)
    
*   Leap year handling (automatic)
    
*   Computes corresponding Saka year, Hindi month and day
    
*   Repeated conversion for multiple dates in one session
    
*   Safe memory management and linked list node traversal
    

Key Concepts
------------

*   **Linked List**: Hindi months managed as nodes in a singly linked list
    
*   **Leap Year Functionality**: isLeapYear() adjusts month days appropriately
    
*   **Day-of-Year Calculation**: getDayOfYear() computes progression
    
*   **Conversion Logic**: Uses Indian National Calendar conventions (Saka Year = Gregorian Year - 78)

Developed as part of Data Structures coursework (First Semester, MCA), showing practical usage of algorithmic concepts.
